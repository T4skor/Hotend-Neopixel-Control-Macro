This macro allows you to control a Neopixel LED based on the temperature of the hotend in a 3D printer running Klipper firmware. The Neopixel changes color depending on the hotend's temperature range:

Green: Hotend is at 40째C or lower.
Purple: Hotend is between 40째C and 100째C.
Red: Hotend is above 100째C.
White: Neopixel turns white when the printer starts a print job.
